    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <p>It's relitivaly simple. Once textpad is open, you will find a fairly simplistic interface.
        It will consist of a text area where you can type your text, an open file button that
        when clicked will open a file dialog where you can select a file to open, a save button that will
        save the text file that you are currently working on and finally a block of text that is gray
        that will display the location of the file that you are currently working on.
